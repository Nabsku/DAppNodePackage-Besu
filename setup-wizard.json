      Besu can use one of two storage formats, Forest of Tries or Bonsai Tries. 

      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Data-Storage-Formats). 

      One major downside of using Bonsai Tries (as of now) is that syncing takes longer since "fast sync" does not work with it.
